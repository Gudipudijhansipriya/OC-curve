# OC-curve
The operating characteristic (OC) curve depicts the discriminatory power of an acceptance sampling plan. The OC curve plots the probabilities of accepting a lot versus the fraction defective.

When the OC curve is plotted, the sampling risks are obvious. 

The Operating Characteristic Curves for Acceptance Sampling for Attributes procedure is a companion
procedure to the procedure Acceptance Sampling for Attributes. This procedure is used view graphically the
probability of lot acceptance versus the lot proportion defective for a given sample size and acceptance
number. Plots with multiple curves for multiple sample sizes or multiple acceptance numbers may be
generated using this procedure.
In this procedure, the lot size can be assumed to be infinite (or continuous) and use the binomial
distribution for calculations, or the lot can have a fixed size, whereupon the calculations are based on the
hypergeometric distribution.
